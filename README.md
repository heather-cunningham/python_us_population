# Python U.S. Population project
A school project from 2017

## Instructions from Prof:

The file, USPopulation.txt, lists the population, in thousands, of the United States during the years 1950 - 1990 (inclusive).  The first line of the file is then population in year 1950, the second line the population in the year 1951 etc.

You are to write a program which reads the contents of the file above into a list; then, calculate and display:
- The average annual change in population during the time period: 1950 - 1990 (inclusive)
- The year with the greatest increase in population during the time period: 1950 - 1990 (inclusive)
- The year with the the smallest increase in population during the time period 1950 - 1990 (inclusive)
